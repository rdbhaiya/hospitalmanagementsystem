# • IDEA EVALUATION 
The idea is to evaluate/build an application for the management of a hospital. 
In this application there would be mainly three interface- 
# 1. ADMINISTRATOR 
Will manage other Users like Doctors,Receptionists and Pharmacits. He can search for Doctors, Receptionists, 
Pharmacits. Admin can view the total dashboard like total Earnings 
today, total Appointments taken today, total Doctors, Receptionists, Patients. 

  o For the hospital administration- 

▪ In this interface there would be a login system for the admin. Where 
the admin had to login in the application using their UserID and 
Password.

▪ Now if the admin member is new and want to create an account, 
he/she will click the SIGN-UP option which will ask the admin to fill up 
all his/her details and Password. After successful 
account creation a random 10-digit ID will be provided for the user.

▪ Now as the admin had successfully created and login into their Account 
they can view- 

   o Details of Doctors- Can also register them 
 
   o Details of Receptionists- Can also register them 
 
   o Details of Patients and their appointments. 
 
   o Total Earnings Today, Total Appointments Taken Today, Total Doctors, Receptionists, Patients
